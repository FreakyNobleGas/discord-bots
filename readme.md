Welcome to Discord Bots! 
---
This repository contains the source code for various bots that I've created for my own Discord servers to help with various tasks.

Voice Chat Bot
--------------
This bot notifies the General channel in the Discord server when a user joins a previously empty voice channel. There is a short timeout for the voice channel when it becomes empty to prevent spamming.

Twitch Bot
----------
This bot notifies the General channel in the Discord server when a Twitch streamer defined in the configuration file goes live on Twitch.

Requirements
------------
Python 3

Commands to Execute Scripts
---------------------------
python3 voice-chat-bot.py\
